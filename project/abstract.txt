DevOps: Automated build and Testing Pipeline for a 3D Unity Project



Abstract:
This project aims to develop an automated build and testing pipeline for a large 3D Unity project, 
made for the IMI showtime this semester. The Unity Project requires multiple gb of storage, due to a new 3D scanning method being used, 
thus Git LFS enhancement is necessary. The central part of the project will be the
Continuous Integration (CI) on a server, such as Jenkins, which will automate the Unity build 
process using scripts that interact with Unityâ€™s CLI. After the CI pipeline has executed the 
process will go into automated tests to ensure the health of the build. This process will 
streamline the development and maintain high quality builds. To further the streamlined 
approach a branching workflow inspired by git flow will be put into place. 
In the documentation I will go into detail about the challenges faced working the pipeline out, 
and deploying a branching workflow in a team of 6.
