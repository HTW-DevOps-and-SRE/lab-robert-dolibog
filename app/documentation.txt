Step one: creation of the basic webservice

I found the first step to be equal parts interesting and difficult. 
Even though I used a framework to make the webservice, I found it difficult to break into it.
After I have gotten used to the syntax and logic of Flask it has gotten better and more interesting.
Due to me not having enough time I couldnt properly figure out how to incorporate the json returns[get and post request] into the html textarea.
But im sure I will figure this out by the next labs deadline.
