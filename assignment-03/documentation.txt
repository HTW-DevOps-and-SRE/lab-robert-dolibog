Git branching:
I didnt have any problems completing the exercise. 
I think the assignment was quite managable and fun this week.
Due to me not having used git in a while it was quite refreshing and interesting to get back into Git/GitHub.
In my remote repository I have included the PR rule for merging main. 
Though I didnt include the required approval before merging. 
I chose this, because I like to establish smaller changes that dont need the extra time.
